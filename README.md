Applied Energistics Localization
==================================================

### English Text

en_US is not included in this repository as it is part of the core project, Do not include an en_US, if you see a typo or misspelling please notify me via IRC. You can pull the latest en_US.properties from the most recent releases in the /mods/appeng/lang/ or /assets/appeng/lang/folders(s).

### Encoding

Files must be encoded as UTF-8.

### License

All Text and Translations submitted here can be used for any purpose, and may be re-distributed or used without any limitations.

### New Translations

You can provide any additional languages by adding the specified language.properties file and adding that file to the lang.list.

### Issues with Localization Support

Feel free to post issues, here on the AE Tracker relating to issues with text not translating or not being translatable, I want to make sure everything that can be translated is available.

### Final Note

The most current english text will be provided by me ( AlgorithmX2 ) which will not be included in this Repo; Anyone else can feel free to post pull requests to update any non-english language files to keep them current and accurate. If you have questions, I'm available on IRC on esper.net in the #AppliedEnergistics Channel.

Thanks to everyone helping out to improve localization of AE.
